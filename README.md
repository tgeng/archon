# Archon

An experimental language that tries to combine dependent type, lexical algebraic effects & handlers,
and quantitative types.

## Design

Overall the core type theory is a mixture of

* [EMLTT of Danel Ahman](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3371126)
* [Effect instance of Dariusz Biernacki et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3371116)
* A
  specialized [graded modal dependent type theory of Andras et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3607862)

The type checker supports meta variable and unification is implemented based on the [Agda
paper](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ulfn/papers/thesis.pdf) by Norell.

On top of that, inductive type and co-pattern matching is implemented based
on [Elaborating dependent
(co)pattern matching](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3236770) from Jesper Cockx et al.

For detailed design, one can check
out [term.scala](src/main/scala/com/github/tgeng/archon/core/ir/term.scala) for core type theory IR
and [typing.scala](src/main/scala/com/github/tgeng/archon/core/ir/typing.scala) for the type
checker.
